    <p> Typography is a tool of communication.
        <br><br><br>It must be communication in its most intense form.
        <br><br>The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this
        <br><br>distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of
        <br><br>ancient pictographic forms. Our intellectual relationship to
        <br><br>the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact
        <br><br>relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation).
        <br><br>This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later
        <br><br>collective- amorphous mode of communication.
        <br><br>Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions.
        <br><br>Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.
        <br><br>The New Typography
        <br>[1923]
